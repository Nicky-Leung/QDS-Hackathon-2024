## Inspiration 

We found inspiration to make this app, based on personal experiences. We have calendars to see our due dates for school, but we don't have something that manages our time for us. Students tend to forget to take care of themselves when they get so busy with school. That was our main goal with Time Master. We wanted this to be an app to help you manage your time, leading to less stress, and a healthier lifestyle.
